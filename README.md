# Accelerating Prefilling for Long-Context Inference via Sparse Pattern Sharing
This repository will host the official source code for the paper: Accelerating Prefilling for Long-Context Inference via Sparse Pattern Sharing.

## Overview
This work introduces *Sparse Pattern Sharing* (SPS), a novel sparse attention method that highly preserves accuracy while accelerating the prefilling phase.
